I am a Professor in Systems Immunology and Machine Learning at the School of Medical Sciences at UNSW Sydney, and I am a visiting fellow at the Garvan Institute for Medical Research and at the Weill Cornell College of Medicine NY, USA. 

My research program uses a Systems Immunology approach to study T cell responses with the ultimate goal to develop and new immunotherapies that can be used against incurable cancer and autoimmune diseases.  I am passionate about Immunology, and of discoveries that are rapidly translating into immunotherapies for uncurable disorders. To achieve this goal I have developed a systems immunology program, which is an interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental and computational analyses to translate new molecular and genomics discoveries to  transform current immunotherapies into successful, precise and accessible solutions for a broader community of individuals.

I have a strong focus on utilising single cell cutting edge technologies genomics and computational biology ML techniques to develop next-generation T cell immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmunity, where I lead discoveries that can then be translated into clinical intervention, such as predicting side effects, identifying new solutions for unmet clinical needs.

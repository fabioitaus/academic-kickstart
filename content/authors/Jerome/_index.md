Having completed his PhD entitled "The development of bioinformatics workflows to explore single-cell multi-omics data from T and B lymphocytes", Jerome is currently working as a Post-doc, performing single cell data analysis and pipeline/application developmen in the fields of auto-immunity and cancer. He is particularly interested in leveraging large T cell multi-omics datasets to explore and predict antigen-specificity and cross-reactivity.

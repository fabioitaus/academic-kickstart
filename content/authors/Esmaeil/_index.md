Hi, I'm Esmaeil and I am a PhD student in Systems Immunology, Immunogenomics, and AI at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). 
With a strong computational background, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a master's degree in Bioinformatics. 
During my master's degree, I worked on the RNA design problem and proposed a novel method for designing functional RNAs. 
In 2018, I founded BioinfCamp, a bioinformatics startup aimed at addressing gaps I identified in the bioinformatics market. 
I am currently a member of LucianiLab and I'm using computational approaches to better understand autoimmune disorders and cancer.

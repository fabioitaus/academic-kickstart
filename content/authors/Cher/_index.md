Hi, I'm Cherelynn I am an honours student studying Bioinformatics at UNSW. 
With a Computer Science background and specialisation in Bioinformatics, my aim this year is to use AI to advance antibody engineering. 
Specifically, I'm investigating the antibody hinge regions using computational approaches that leverage cutting-edge structural prediction tools. 
Through data analysis and machine learning, I'm working to uncover how we can better engineer antibody therapies for celiac disease.

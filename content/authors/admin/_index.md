Welcome to our multi-disciplinary lab, where we integrate immunology, bioinformatics, AI, and genomics to advance our understanding of autoimmune disorders and cancer. 
Our vision is to develop a precise cure for autoimmune diseases and cancers, by integrating computational models, artificial intelligence and immunogenomics

### Research Focus

Our lab investigates T cell responses across various contexts:
- Autoimmune diseases: Coeliac disease, Type 1 diabetes 
- Immunotherapies: CAR T cell therapies, Immuno-checkpoint
- Ageing

### Technologies
To achieve our goals, we utilize:
- Artificial intelligence to predict immune target 
- Single-cell genomics
- Bioinformatics
- Experimental immunology

We invite PhD and Postdocs to join us, engaging in both 'wet' (laboratory) and 'dry' (computational) projects. PhD Scholarships are available for international candidates, and Summer Research Scholarships for third-year undergraduates.

#### Alumni
- Raymond Louie, now Lecturer at UNSW
- David Koppstein, now Group leader at DKTK Heidelberg
- Lies Boelen, now Senior  Data Analyst
- Preston Leung, Senior postdoc in genomics at Prince of Wales hospital
- Thiruni Adikari, now postdoc at Oxford
- Curtis Cai, now postdoc at Karolinska Institutet

## Goals of our lab

Our lab is multi-disciplinary and combines immunology, bioinformatics, mathematics and statistics, and molecular biology for understanding how immune cells respond to pathogens and cancer. 

PhD and Honours candidates are welcome to join us and work on either
'wet' (laboratory) or 'dry' (computational) projects (or both). 
PhD Scholarships are available for international candidates. Summer Research Scholarships are available for third year undergraduates.

### Diseases we are studying

Our lab focused on T cell responses in the context of when these cells works well (Influenza and Dengue virus), when they are not supposed to respond but they do (Coeliac disease), and when they have been engineered to do what we want (CAR T cell therapies)
It appears a very broad range of interest, but the reality is that we are simply trying to understand what are the mechanisms that control such a wide outcome for these very important cells of our immune system!

### Technologies we use to achieve these goals.
Single cell genomics

Bioinformatics

Experimental Immunology

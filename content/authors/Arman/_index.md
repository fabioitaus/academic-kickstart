Hi, I’m Arman. I’m a PhD student in Immunogenomics. 
With a background in molecular and cell biology, I transitioned from wet-lab work to computational research to better understand how T cells function in cancer immunotherapy. 
My research focuses on single-cell multi-omics and whole-genome sequencing to explore how CAR T cells behave in patients with B-cell malignancies. 
A central part of my work is investigating rare but serious outcomes, such as the development of CAR T-cell-induced lymphoma. 
Using data from longitudinal patient samples, I integrate transcriptomic, genomic, and clonotype information to uncover the mechanisms that drive clinical outcomes or malignant transformation. 
My broader interest lies in combining immunology with machine learning to improve the safety and effectiveness of next-generation cell therapies.

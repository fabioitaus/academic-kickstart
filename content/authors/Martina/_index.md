Hi, I'm Martina.
I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics, but my curiosity about the immune system led me to shift my focus to immunology. 
During my PhD, I'm exploring the role of T cells in cancer immunotherapy, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy.
However, my main research project focuses on the structural properties of T cell receptors (TCRs) and how these relate to antigen-binding affinity. 
To do this, I use AI to uncover predictive rules that could guide the design of precision immunotherapies.

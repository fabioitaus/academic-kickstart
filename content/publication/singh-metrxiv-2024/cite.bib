	abstract = {Intestinal inflammation continues in a subset of celiac disease (CD) patients despite a gluten-free diet. Here, by applying multiomic single cell analysis to duodenal biopsies, we find low-grade malignancies with lymphoma driver mutations in refractory CD type 2 (RCD2) patients comprise surface CD3 negative (sCD3-) lymphocytes stalled at an innate lymphoid cell (ILC) - progenitor T cell stage undergoing extensive TCR recombination. In people with refractory CD type 1 (RCD1), who currently lack explanation, we discover sCD3+ T cells with lymphoma driver mutations forming large clones displaying inflammatory and cytotoxic molecular profiles in 6 of 10 individuals, and a single small clone in 1 of 4 active recently diagnosed CD cases. Accumulation of driver-mutated T cells and their sCD3-progenitors may explain chronic, non-responsive autoimmunity.One-Sentence Summary Treatment refractory autoimmunity in celiac disease may be explained by dysregulated T cells and progenitors that have acquired lymphoma-driver mutations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Bill and Patricia Ritchie Foundation, the Bill Ferris Scholarship, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia (NHMRC) grants APP2010084, APP2028765, APP2010134, APP1113904 and APP1176553, SPHERE Triple I and the UNSW Cellular Genomics Futures Institute.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Human Research Ethics Committees from Melbourne Health (approval n. 2020.162) and Western Sydney Health District (n. 2021/ETH01429) gave ethical approvals for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
